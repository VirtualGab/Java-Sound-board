To use the application on windows, exec the soundboard.bat file (You need Java 21 installed).



Do not remove pan.wav as it's necessary for the configuration of the application.



The configuration of a VAD is not included in this application, but there's a simple guide inside.



The application supports only .wav audio files!



Have fun with your soundboard!
