Heads-up before installing:

-   You need JDK 21 installed to execute this application.

-   Do not remove/move pan.wav from the same folder as all the other files, because it's necessary for the configuration of the     application.

-   To update the application to a new released version without clearing settings, replace just the .jar files.

-   The configuration of a VAD is not included in this application, I suggest you search one online before installing the application.


-   The application supports only .wav audio files! (at the moment)


-   With the change I've commited on 9/9/25, you can speak with the same output as the VAD (so that you don't have to switch mics while playing the soundboard).



Have fun with your soundboard!
